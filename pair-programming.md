 > “Let’s do some pair programming!” - What does it mean

 1. How Pair Programming works?
   Pair programming is basically a growing software development technique in which two individuals work on the single block of code.
   The programmers undertake one of two parts — the Driver and the navigator.
   The driver in the process is responsible for diligently drafting code, while the navigator’s job is to review and concentrates on the plan of action.

 > Pair programmers: Keep each other on task. Brainstorm refinements to the system. Clarify ideas. Take initiative when their partner is stuck,   thus lowering frustration. Hold each other accountable to the team’s practices. 

 >  The objective is to share the workload between both the participants in order to maintain the constant development stream and also to help 
 spread knowledge over the team.

 >  Pair programming teaches you a lot of the soft skills you’ll need: tolerance, respect, understanding and responsibility.
