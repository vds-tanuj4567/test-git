# Version Control System: git

### Plan 
1. Explain what is version , it's need ,types of version numbers and some live examples to determine the version number of software.

 > Consider a software initially with some features. After doing some major modifications to the code and adding new things the version changes. 

2. Explain what is version control and it's need.

>  Used in companies  where software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code.One developer on the team may be working on a new feature while another developer fixes an unrelated bug by changing code which promotes collaborative work ,reverting errors.

3. Explain different version control systems and explain why git is more popular among all.

> Git is most popular version control system because  it does not use any server-client system but rather uses a distributed system as every system directory acts as a full-fledged repository with complete history of changes.

4. Explain what is centralised version control system,where it is used, pros and cons and some examples which uses this mechanism.

5. Explain what is distributed version control system,where it is used, pros and cons and some examples which uses this mechanism and compare CVS and DVCS.

> Consider a company where software developers working in teams are continually writing new source code and changing existing source code over time.
Which  type of version control is more preferrable for this purpose?
